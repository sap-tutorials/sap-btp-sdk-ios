[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Real world use case)]

![Airport Scene](img-1.jpg)

You have built a native iOS application for the ground staff service technicians of an airline company.

Using the multi-tenancy capabilities of BTP and SAP Mobile Services, you are providing the software to two airline companies.

The airline teams are happy with your software, but they want the application to use the brand colours of their respective organizations.

You anticipate selling the software to more airlines in the future. Therefore, you don't want to maintain multiple code-lines with custom theme for each customer.

*In this tutorial, you will learn how to apply custom theme to your application without needing to re-deploy your native application. Click [here](https://help.sap.com/doc/f53c64b93e5140918d676b927a3cd65b/Cloud/en-US/docs-en/guides/features/application-themes/ios/theming.html) to learn more about custom theme support on SAP BTP SDK iOS.*
